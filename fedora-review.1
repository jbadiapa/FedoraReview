.SH NAME
fedora-review \- Customized review template for Fedora packages

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fedora-review
[options] -b <bug>
.br
.B fedora-review
[options] [--prebuilt] -n <package name>
.br
.B fedora-review
[options] [--prebuilt] -rn <srpm path>
.br
.B fedora-review
[options] -u <url>

.SH DESCRIPTION

Makes reviews of rpm packages for Fedora easier by providing
a customized review template, automating some trivial tasks. The tool
runs a number of checks to test whether a package complies to the
Fedora Packaing Guidelines before creating the template.  Through a
bash API the checks can be extended. We have at the moment checks for
C/C++, R, Java and Perl packages.

.SH USAGE
Basic usage:
.IP "" 4
$ fedora-review -b <bug number>
.br
$ fedora-review -u <url>
.PP
Will download the SPEC & SRPM files from the Bugzilla report,
build them in mock, run a number of tests and generate a template.

Not all bugzillas support the -b option. The -u option is available
for these.  See  --url usage notes below.
.IP "" 4
$ fedora-review -n <package name>
.PP
This alternative usage expects <package name>.spec and source rpm in current
directory. By adding the -p switch, fedora-review uses already built rpms
in current directory instead of building using mock.
.IP "" 4
$ fedora-review --rpm-spec -n <srpm path>
.PP
This form accepts a single path to a source rpm. It uses the specfile
bundled in the srpm package.
.PP
You will need to have mock installed and be member of the mock group
for the build to work. Run as root:
.IP "" 4
# usermod -a -G mock [your user name]
.PP
After this, you will need to logout and login again (or use newgrp(1)) - the
changes in user's group list is not read until a new login.
.SH MODE OPTIONS - one is required
.TP 4
.B -b, --bug <bug nr>
Run against Fedora bugzilla at bugzilla.redhat.com, using the bugzilla
bug number
.TP 4
.B -n, --name <name>
Runs the checks against the named spec and source rpm located in the
current working directory. The files are expected to have the names
<name>.spec and <name>*.src.rpm.
When used together with --rpm-spec/-r, name can also be a complete path
to a source rpm.
.TP 4
.B -u url, --url <url>
Fetch data from given url, typically another bugzilla instance
such as rpmfusion. Before using this, first try
the more convenient --bug <bug nr> --other-bz <url>.
The option tries to retrieve the URL:s by scanning the page.
See URL Limitations for how the url must look to be found.
.TP 4
.B  -d, --display-checks
List all available checks, usable as arguments to --exclude and
--single
.TP 4
.B  -f, --display-flags
List all available flags, usable as arguments to --define or -D.
.TP 4
.B  -g, --display-plugins
List all plugins which can be enabled/disabled using --plugins.
.TP 4
.B  -V, --version
Show version info
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP 4
.B -B, --no-colors
Disable use of ansi colors in console output.
.TP 4
.B -c, --cache
Do not redownload the files from bugzilla or upstream, use the local ones
from previous run instead.
.TP 4
.B -D, --define <flag[=value]>
Define a flag e. g., EPEL5. A flag can either just be activated
using
flag
or set to a value using
flag=value.
--display-flags shows available flags.
.TP 4
.B -k, --checksum <md5|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512>
Algorithm used for checksum.
.TP 4
.B -L, --local-repo <rpm directory>
Directory with rpms to install together with reviewed
package during build and install phases.
.TP 4
.B -m, --mock-config <configuration>
Specify which mock config to use, one of the files in /etc/mock,
with the .cfg suffix stripped. Defaults to the root defined in
/etc/mock/default.cfg
.TP 4
.B -o, --mock-options "options..."
Mock options for the build. Defaults to --no-cleanup-after, you might
want this along with other options
you provide.
.TP 4
.B --no-report
Do not generate the review template.
.TP 4
.B --no-build
Do not rebuild or install the source rpm, instead use the last installed
package available in mock. Implies --cache.
.TP 4
.B --other_bz
Url of alternative bugzilla, instead of using default
https://bugzilla.redhat.com
.TP 4
.B -p, --prebuilt
When using -n <name>, use prebuilt rpms in current directory instead
of building new ones in mock
.TP 4
.B -P, --plugins
Normally, the right plugin(s) to run are autodetected. Using --plugins
overrides the decision to run a plugin or not. The argument is a
comma-separated list of plugins, each possibly with a :off suffix e. g.,
.IP "" 8
--plugins Java:off,C/C++
.PP
.IP "" 4
Use --display-plugins to see available plugins. Enabling plugins has no 
well-defined semantics: some tests might leave no trace in the report
even though they are actually run.
.TP 4
.B -r, --rpm-spec
Instead of using a spec file URL, use the spec file bundled in the srpm file.
.TP 4
.B -s test, --single test
Run a single test, as listed by --display-checks. Does not run dependencies,
only the given test.
.TP 4
.B  -v, --verbose
Provides a more detailed output of what's going on.
.TP 4
.B -x  "test1, test2, ...", --exclude "test1, test2, ..."
Comma-separated list of test(s) to exclude, as listed by --display-checks.
A test which depends on an excluded test, will run.
.SH THE REVIEW DIRECTORY
The report template create by fedora-review lives in a review directory.
Besides the report, here is:
.TP 4
srpm directory
Holds whats downloaded, normally a src.rpm and a
spec file. When using --rpm-spec, here is no .spec file.
.TP 4
srpm-unpacked directory
Holds the unpacked content of the src.rpm
file.
.TP 4
upstream directory
contains sources downloaded from the Source: url in the spec file.
.TP 4
upstream-unpacked directory
Occasionally contains the unpacked sources, but is normally empty.
.TP 4
dependencies
Used for dependencies specfiles when EXARCH flag is set, otherwise empty.
.TP 4
BUILD link
Points to the mock directory containing the sources used in
the build. These sources have been created and modifified by the %prep
stuff in the spec file. The link is only valid direct after the run,
it's overwritten next time mock executes.
.TP 4
results directory
Contains the result from the build, logs and rpm packages.
.SH LOCAL SOURCES (GIT-BASED OR SIMILAR)
Normally, the Source0 (or others SourceX) in the specfile contains an URL
to the upstream source. fedora-review uses this url to download the
upstream source and then compare md5sum with source in rpm.

However, in some cases the Source0: is just a filename e. g., when sources
are generated from git, svn or similar tools. In these cases, fedora-review
will look for a file matching the Source0 in current directory. If it exists,
it's used as upstream source. This way, a reviewer can generate the source
according the comments in the spec before running fedora-review and then
have it checked.
.SH USING KOJI SCRATCH BUILDS
It's possible to use koji to build packages instead of mock when using
fedora-review. The basic idea is to run a koji scratch build, download
the built packages and invoke fedora-review on these. This workflow
uses the --prebuilt option, and has some limitations on checks performed
since fedora-review cannot access the build directories.
.PP
The workflow:
.IP \(bu 3
Invoke koji, note the task number:
.IP "" 8
koji build --scratch my-package.src.rpm
.IP \(bu 3
Download the results:
.IP "" 8
koji-download-scratch <task number>
.IP \(bu 3
Invoke fedora-review using --prebuilt, --name options and --rpmspec:
.IP "" 8
fedora-review --rpm-spec --prebuilt --name my-package

.SH URL limitations
fedora-review handles two types of URL: the spec and srpm url found in
e. g. the bugzilla page, and the source url(s) found in the spec file.

For the srpm and spec file url:
.IP \(bu 3
The parameters (i. e., the ? and everything beyond) is removed.
.IP \(bu 3
The rest must end with /*.spec or /*.src.rpm

.P
For the source url, possible parameters are
.B not
removed. It must end with /filename, typically something like
/package-2.0.1.tar.gz

.SH EXAMPLES
Make a report template for Fedora bug 817271:
.IP "" 4
$ fedora-review -b 817271
.PP
fetches spec and srpm file from bugzilla.redhat.com and makes a report.
To instead handle a bug at rpmfusion use something like
.IP "" 4
$ fedora-review --url \\
.br
https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2150 \\
.br
--mock-config fedora-16-i386-rpmfusion_free
.PP
Occasionally, fedora-review isn't able to pick up the links e. g.,
when the links does not end in .spec and/or .src.rpm. In these case
you need to download files manually. Using --rpm-spec only the srpm
is needed:
.nf
.IP "" 4
$ wget http://somewhere.com/bad-srpmlink -O my-package-1.2-1.fc16.src.rpm
$ fedora-review --rpm-spec -n my-package-1.2-1.fc16.src.rpm
.fi

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B REVIEW_LOGLEVEL
loglevel used when not using -v/--verbose. A logging.* value like 'DEBUG', 'Info', or 'warning'. Setting
REVIEW_LOGLEVEL to 'debug' is the same as providing the -v/--verbose option.
.TP
.B REVIEW_NO_MOCKGROUP_CHECK
Normally, fedora-review checks  that user is member of the mock group
before proceeding since this is required to run mock in most setups.
In cases this check is not useful it can be suppressed by this variable.
.TP
.B XDG_DATA_HOME
fedora-review respects XDG_DATA_HOME which defaults to ~/.local/share. E. g.,
the personal data directory with plugins is by default ~/.local/share/fedora-review/plugins,
but is $XDG_DATA_HOME/fedora-review/plugins if XDG_DATA_HOME is set. See FILES.
.TP
.B XDG_CACHE_HOME
If set, defines the directory where the logfile fedora-review.log is written.
Defaults to ~/.cache.
